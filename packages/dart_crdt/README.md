## Overview

A pure Dart CRDT package for local-first collaborative data structures.

`dart_crdt` provides document state, shared collection/text types, binary update
encoding, relative positions, snapshots, undo/redo, attribution metadata, and
compatibility-oriented fixtures for VM, Flutter, and web runtimes.

## Supported Features

| Area | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Documents | Client IDs, transactions, roots, observers, lifecycle events, and subdocuments. |
| Presence | Awareness state, local presence fields, update exchange, and offline removals. |
| Shared types | Arrays, maps, text, XML-like trees, nested types, embeds, and attributes. |
| Sync | Deterministic V1/V2 updates, state vectors, merge/diff helpers, update conversion, and update application. |
| Editing | Rich-text deltas, snapshots, relative positions, undo/redo, and attribution metadata. |
| Validation | Serialized fixtures, malformed-input fuzzing, coverage gates, benchmarks, and compiled web checks. |

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_crdt: ^0.4.0
```

```dart
import 'package:dart_crdt/dart_crdt.dart';
```

## Quick Start

Create a document and mutate a shared text type:

```dart
final doc = Doc();
final text = doc.getText('body');

text.insertText(0, 'Hello, local-first Dart.');

print(text.toPlainText()); // Hello, local-first Dart.
```

Shared arrays, maps, text, XML fragments/elements/text, and nested shared types
are available through `SharedType` APIs.

```dart
final list = doc.getArray('items');
list.push('one');
list.push(SharedType(kind: SharedTypeKind.map, name: 'nested'));

final map = doc.getMap('settings');
map.setAttr('theme', 'light');
```

## Update Exchange

Use state updates to exchange CRDT state between replicas or providers. Updates
are idempotent and can be safely applied more than once.

```dart
final local = Doc(clientId: ClientId(1));
local.getText('root').insertText(0, 'sync');

final update = encodeStateAsUpdate(local);

final remote = Doc(clientId: ClientId(9));
applyUpdate(remote, update);

print(remote.getText('root').toPlainText()); // sync
```

V2 update helpers are also available:

```dart
final updateV2 = encodeStateAsUpdateV2(local);
applyUpdateV2(remote, updateV2);
```

Providers can also merge updates, diff them against a state vector, and inspect
an update's state vector without first materializing a document:

```dart
final merged = mergeUpdates([update]);
final stateVector = encodeStateVectorFromUpdate(merged);
final missing = diffUpdate(merged, stateVector);
```

`encodeStateVectorFromUpdate` and its V2 counterpart report only concrete
client clocks that the update proves contiguously from clock zero. Wire `Skip`
framing, unresolved ranges, and target-relative deltas that begin above zero do
not claim the missing prefix. When inspecting a target-relative delta, combine
the extracted vector with the target vector that was used to produce it.

In `0.4.0`, merge/diff, update-format conversion, and update obfuscation are
safe only for causally complete input. They currently materialize a temporary
document and omit unresolved structs. Providers that accept out-of-order
updates must retain the original update journal until all pending dependencies
have integrated; `encodeStateAsUpdate` also emits integrated state only.

## Awareness And Presence

`Awareness` tracks ephemeral presence state such as users, cursors, selections,
and online/offline status. It is provider-neutral: transports can broadcast the
encoded updates over WebSocket, WebRTC, local storage, isolates, or any other
message channel.

```dart
final local = Awareness(localClientId: ClientId(1));
final remote = Awareness(localClientId: ClientId(2));

local.setLocalState({
  'user': {'name': 'Ada'},
  'cursor': 7,
});

final update = encodeAwarenessUpdate(local);
applyAwarenessUpdate(remote, update);
print(remote.states[ClientId(1)]?.toObject());
```

## Rich Text And Deltas

Shared text supports formatting attributes and delta rendering.

```dart
final doc = Doc();
final text = doc.getText('body');

text.insertText(
  0,
  'Important',
  attributes: DeltaAttributes.fromJson({'bold': true}),
);

final delta = text.toDelta();
print(delta.toJson());
```

You can also apply package-native deltas:

```dart
final builder = DeltaBuilder()
  ..insertText(text: 'hello')
  ..retain(
    length: 5,
    attributes: DeltaAttributes.fromJson({'italic': true}),
  );
final delta = builder.done();

text.applyDelta(delta);
```

## Undo And Redo

`UndoManager` tracks CRDT transactions for a document or shared-type scope.

```dart
final doc = Doc(gc: false, clientId: ClientId(9));
final undoManager = UndoManager(doc);
final source = Doc(clientId: ClientId(1));

source.getText('root').insertText(0, 'draft');

applyUpdate(doc, encodeStateAsUpdate(source));

undoManager.undo();
undoManager.redo();
undoManager.destroy();
```

Tracked origins, capture timeouts, delete filters, stack events, and scoped
undo/redo are supported.

## Diff Attribution And Suggestions

`DiffAttributionManager` can accept or reject all changes between two
documents. The range-shaped `acceptChanges` and `rejectChanges` methods remain
source-compatible in `0.4.0`, but arbitrary partial decisions fail closed with
`UnsupportedError`: they are supported only when the supplied range covers all
remaining suggestions, in which case they delegate to `acceptAllChanges` or
`rejectAllChanges`. This avoids manufacturing a non-contiguous causal history.

Rejecting all changes synchronizes the complete post-undo state to both
documents, including insertion tombstones and ids created while restoring
deletions, so later successor and adjacent edits can integrate normally.

## Relative Positions

Relative positions anchor to CRDT content and can be encoded, stored, sent over
the network, and resolved against a document later.

Shared-text indexes use Unicode scalar values, matching Dart `String.runes` and
the package's text mutation APIs. The portable wire format still uses UTF-16
clocks; relative-position helpers convert between the two units.

```dart
final source = Doc(clientId: ClientId(1));
source.getText('body').insertText(0, 'hello');

final doc = Doc();
final text = doc.getText('body');
applyUpdate(doc, encodeStateAsUpdate(source));

final position = createRelativePositionFromTypeIndex(text, 2);
final encoded = encodeRelativePosition(position);
final resolved = createAbsolutePositionFromRelativePosition(
  decodeRelativePosition(encoded),
  doc,
);

print(resolved?.index);
```

## Snapshots

Snapshots capture a document version as a state-vector and delete-set pair.
Snapshot restoration requires a source document with garbage collection
disabled so deleted content remains available.

```dart
final doc = Doc(gc: false);
final snap = snapshot(doc);
final bytes = encodeSnapshot(snap);
final restored = createDocFromSnapshot(doc, decodeSnapshot(bytes));
```

## Binary Compatibility

The package includes deterministic V1 and V2 update encoders/decoders, state
vectors, delete sets, update merge/diff helpers, update format conversion,
obfuscation helpers, content-id inspection, serialized fixtures, and compiled
web smoke coverage.

Malformed input is validated with typed exceptions, and binary behavior is
covered by unit, integration, fixture, fuzz, benchmark, and compiled web
checks.

## Stability

`0.4.0` is a pre-1.0 release. Public APIs may change before `1.0.0`,
but binary behavior is covered by regression fixtures and compatibility tests.

Current known limitations:

- Binary merge/diff, format conversion, and obfuscation omit unresolved structs
  from causally incomplete input. Keep the original update bytes until their
  dependencies have integrated.
- `encodeStateAsUpdate` and `encodeStateAsUpdateV2` do not yet re-emit raw
  pending struct updates.
- Arbitrary partial `DiffAttributionManager` accept/reject decisions are not
  supported; select all remaining suggestions or use the explicit all-change
  methods.
- Formatting attributes applied through root or nested `SharedText` APIs are
  not yet stored in CRDT structs. Plain text syncs, but formatting runs do not.
