## 0.2.2

Bug-fix release: lossless reconstruction of interleaved concurrent inserts from
a single full-state update.

### API Changes

- No public API changes.

### Fixes

- Fixed silent data loss when a single full-state update (`encodeStateAsUpdate`,
  `encodeStateAsUpdateV2`, or a `mergeUpdates` fold) built from two or more
  clients' interleaved concurrent inserts at random interior positions was
  applied to a fresh document. The pending-struct retry loop measured progress
  by the number of pending update *entries*, but a single update whose structs
  carry forward cross-client origin dependencies re-pends itself as the same one
  entry every pass, so the entry count never decreased and the loop stopped
  after a single retry — dropping every struct beyond the second dependency
  layer (e.g. a 160-character co-edited document reconstructed to 22
  characters). The retry now loops until a full pass integrates no further
  structs, so a snapshot of any interleaving converges. The 0.2.1 fix for
  out-of-order delivery of multiple updates is preserved; append-only and
  already-causal updates are unaffected (they integrate on the first pass and
  never re-pend).

### Compatibility Summary

- Wire format, state vectors, and update encoding are unchanged and remain
  byte-compatible with 0.2.0 and 0.2.1. The fix only changes the in-memory retry
  loop that re-applies causally-incomplete updates; no serialized bytes change.
- The behavioural change is strictly corrective: documents that previously
  reconstructed with dropped content now reconstruct in full. No previously
  correct result changes.

### Benchmark Summary

- The common in-order path is unchanged: a causally-complete update leaves
  nothing pending, so the retry loop body never executes and adds no overhead.
- When reconstructing a document from a single update that carries forward
  dependencies (e.g. applying a full-state snapshot of an interleaved concurrent
  history), the retry performs one pass over the pending set per dependency
  layer — previously capped at a single pass. Each struct still integrates at
  most once. This cost is bounded and paid only on that reconstruction path.

### Known Limitations

- Relative positions anchored to a nested (non-root) shared type via a type id
  still resolve against a detached placeholder; nested-type anchors are not yet
  fully supported (root- and item-anchored positions are unaffected).

### Verification

- `melos run format`
- `melos run analyze`
- `melos run test`
- `melos run test:long-random`
- `dart pub publish --dry-run`

## 0.2.1

Bug-fix release: web compilation, full-clear crashes, and out-of-order sync
data loss.

### API Changes

- No public API changes. `StructStore` now retains multiple pending struct
  updates internally (`pendingStructUpdates`) instead of a single slot; the
  existing `pendingStructUpdate` getter is preserved and returns the most
  recent pending update.

### Fixes

- Fixed web (`dart2js`/`dart compile js`) compilation: the content-attribute
  digest no longer uses 64-bit integer literals (`0xffffffffffffffff`,
  `0xcbf29ce484222325`) that cannot be represented exactly in JavaScript. The
  FNV-1a hash is now computed across two 32-bit lanes using only arithmetic
  that is exact on every Dart platform, producing the same 16-hex digest on the
  VM and the web.
- Fixed an `ArgumentError` crash when a single transaction empties a text type
  or array entirely (e.g. select-all then delete). `deleteText`/`delete` no
  longer pre-clamp the search-marker index with `clamp(0, length - 1)`, which
  threw `clamp(0, -1)` once the last item was removed.
- Fixed silent data loss on out-of-order update delivery. When two (or more)
  causally-incomplete updates arrived before their dependencies, the second
  overwrote the first's pending struct bytes, so the first update's content was
  lost forever once dependencies arrived. Pending updates are now retained as a
  list and retried to a fixpoint, so every update converges regardless of
  arrival order.

### Compatibility Summary

- Wire format, state vectors, and update encoding are unchanged and remain
  byte-compatible with 0.2.0. The pending-update fix only affects in-memory
  handling of causally-incomplete updates and changes no serialized bytes.
- The content-attribute `stableHash` digest value changed (it is now web-safe).
  The digest is in-memory only — never serialized or exchanged — so this does
  not affect cross-document sync or persisted data.

### Benchmark Summary

- No benchmark-relevant changes; hot paths (encode/decode, integration) are
  untouched. The pending-update retry now loops to a fixpoint but only over the
  set of causally-incomplete updates, which is empty on the common in-order
  path.

### Known Limitations

- Relative positions anchored to a nested (non-root) shared type via a type id
  still resolve against a detached placeholder; nested-type anchors are not yet
  fully supported (root- and item-anchored positions are unaffected).

### Verification

- `melos run format`
- `melos run analyze`
- `melos run test`
- `melos run js:smoke`
- `dart pub publish --dry-run`

## 0.2.0

Adds the first production-oriented sync path for high-level shared text edits
and rounds out several public convenience APIs.

### API Changes

- Added provider-neutral `Awareness` presence state with binary update
  encoding, application, and offline removal helpers.
- Added typed root helpers: `getMap`, `getArray`, `getText`, and
  `getXmlFragment`.
- Added update-only state-vector helpers for V1 and V2 updates.
- Added `EventHandler.once`.
- Added XML child insertion after a reference node.

### Fixes

- Fixed root `SharedText.insertText` and `deleteText` so high-level text edits
  produce CRDT structs, encode into V1/V2 state updates, apply on remote
  documents, and converge for concurrent inserts.
- Fixed update integration to clean item boundaries for middle text inserts.
- Updated README and examples to use the public shared text API instead of raw
  `Item(ContentString(...))` setup.

### Verification

- `melos run analyze --no-select`
- `melos run test --no-select`
- `dart run tool/validate_repository.dart`
- `dart pub publish --dry-run`

## 0.1.0

Initial public release with package metadata, documentation, tests,
benchmarks, CI scaffolding, and the core Dart CRDT API surface.

### API Changes

- Introduced the initial package API surface for local-first collaborative
  documents, shared types, binary updates, rich text, snapshots, relative
  positions, undo/redo, attribution metadata, and validation fixtures.

### Compatibility Summary

- Added neutral compatibility fixtures and binary update validation coverage.
- Release validation passed serialized fixture round trips, long random
  convergence, compiled web smoke checks, and package policy scans.

### Benchmark Summary

- Added benchmark smoke and full-suite entrypoints with baseline thresholds.
- Full benchmark run covered 24 benchmarks. Slowest cases were
  `metadata_id_map_algebra` at 74.75 ms/iteration and
  `array_random_insert_delete_nested` at 63.93 ms/iteration, both below the
  500 ms full-suite threshold.

### Known Limitations

- This is a pre-1.0 release and is not a stable `1.0.0` API contract.
- No release blockers are open from the current audit.

### Verification

- `melos run test`
- `melos run test:long-random`
- `melos run coverage` at 95.21% overall with strict codec/metadata/update
  algebra thresholds passing.
- `melos run benchmark:full`
- `melos run docs`
- `melos run js:smoke`
- `melos run release:validate`
- `dart pub publish --dry-run` with 0 warnings.
